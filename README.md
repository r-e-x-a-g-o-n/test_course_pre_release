## Prerequisites
One needs to install:-
1. Python (Python3 is recommended.)
2. Docker and Docker Compose
3. Ubuntu is recommended, and some basic knowledge in Linux is required.

## Master Notebook Preparation
### Your Course Directory
Make a new repository for your course, and copy contents inside `TEST_COURSE` repository into your course repository. In `TEST_COURSE` repository, you will find all related files and directories needed for the notebook extraction. Put your course repository beside the repositories of `AssignmentNotebook`, `Autograder`, `StudiumInterface`, etc.  

### Master Notebook Creation
To create a master notebook, please see examples of master notebooks and read the description in the section below:- 

- See `Example_databricks.dbc` for an example of a databricks master notebook
- Use `Example_Jupyter.ipynb` for an example of a Jupyter master notebook

> **NOTE !**
> The construction of a master notebook for both databricks and Jupyter is the same. The difference is just the file format.

> For databricks notebook, one may use magic line (`%python` or `%scala`) as desired to switch between languages in a single notebook. **However, for Jupyter notebook, do not put `%python` in any cells of Jupyter notebook; otherwise, the master notebook cannot be extracted.** Actually, as it only supports Python language (with SageMath kernel), there is no need to put `%python` in any cells anyway. 

> All master notebooks have to be extracted into lecture and assignment notebooks using our system; otherwise, the student submission notebooks cannot be graded in our system !

As seen in the examples of the master notebooks, there are different cell types with different cell tags one needs to strictly specify. Generally, it consists of:-

1. **Lecture Part**
This part includes lecture notes, pictures, VDO, websites, etc. in markdown cells. It can also includes code cells for students to play along with the lecture. Hence, there can be more than one lecture cells and, of course, they can be put in any places in the notebook. These lecture cells do not need any tags, and will be extracted into a lecture notebook.

2. **Assignment Part**
The assignment part is where an instructor creates problems for students as homework. In one assignment, it can include more than one problem, and for each problem, it needs to have 4 cell types along with cell tags as follows:-

	- **Problem Cell**
	In one problem, it can have more than one problem cell. For example, one can specify a problem statement in one markdown cell, and put codes with some parts left blank in a code cell for students to fill in. It can also be a code cell where students have to put in a correct choice, number or string into a variable. These cells will be extracted to an assignment notebook and have to be tagged with the following comment in the first line.
	
		For scala,
		
	    `// ASSIGNMENT 1, Problem 1, Points 2`
    
		For Python,
		
	    `# ASSIGNMENT 1, Problem 1, Points 2`
    > See an example of Problem cell in the template
    
	- **Test Cell**
	The Test cell is a cell that an instructor has to put in a code for students to run to check whether their codes or answers in a corresponding problem cell is in a correct format or not, e.g. String, Integer, List of Integer, RDD and so on. In one problem, it can have only one Test cell. The Test cell will be extracted along with problem cells to an assignment notebook and has to be tagged with the following comment in the first line.
	
		For scala,
		
	    `// ASSIGNMENT 1, Test 1, Points 2`
	    
		For Python,
		
	    `# ASSIGNMENT 1, Test 1, Points 2`
	    
	    > See an example of Test cell in the template
    	
	- **TEST Cell**
		The TEST cell is a cell where an instructor has to put test cases, or correct answers for variables. The instructior has to write a code to check whether students' codes satisfy all test cases or students' answers are correct and adjust scores accordingly. In one problem, it can have only one TEST cell. The TEST cell will be appended to students' submission notebooks when grading. The TEST cell has to be tagged with the following comment in the first line.
	
		For scala,

		  // ASSIGNMENT 1, TEST 1, Points 2
		  var local_points = 0
    
		For Python,

		  # ASSIGNMENT 1, TEST 1, Points 2
    	  local_points = 0
    > **NOTE !**
    In every TEST cell, it is necessary to initialize a `local_points` variable to 0, and if the student answer is correct, then add  up a point to this variable, e.g. `local_points = local_points + 2` (in case it is worth 2 points).
    
    > See an example of TEST cell in the template
    
    
	- **SOLUTION Cell**
		The SOLUTION cell is a cell that an instructor puts correct codes or answers just for a reference. In one problem, it can have only one SOLUTION cell. The SOLUTION cell has to be tagged with the following comment in the first line.
	
		For scala,
  
	    `// ASSIGNMENT 1, SOLUTION 1, Points 2`

		For Python,
		
	    `# ASSIGNMENT 1, SOLUTION 1, Points 2`
    > See an example of SOLUTION cell in the template

	> **WARNING !!!**
	> Don't be confused between **Test** and **TEST** cells !!!

### Directories for Storing Master Notebooks
One has to export master notebooks and store them in a proper place. For Jupyter notebooks, just export them as *.ipynb*, and for databricks notebooks, export them as *.dbc*. Then, for the locations to store them, go into the course directory. For Jupyter notebooks, save them in `master/jp`, and for databricks notebooks, save them in `master/dbc`.

## Master Notebook Extraction
### Pre-configured file
For the extraction of lecture and assignment notebooks out of a master notebook, one has to pre-configure `config.json` stored inside `AssignmentNotebook` directory (There is also a symbolic link of `AssignmentNotebook` in `GenerateMaterial` directory in your course repository). See an example of the configuration below.

    {
	    "master_notebooks":["A1_MASTER, A2_MASTER, A3_MASTER"],
	    "notebook_file_extension":"db",
	    "notebook_folder":"master/db",
	    "target_notebook_folder":"lectures",
	    "target_notebook_book_folder":"Notebooks",
	    "assignments":[1,2],
	    "CourseID":"58713",
	    "CourseName":"Scalable Data Science and Distributed Machine Learning",
	    "CourseInstance":"2022"
    }

> One must make sure all directories specified in `config.json` exist !

The description of each key in `config.json` is in the table below:-

| Key | Description |
|--|--|
| master_notebooks | A list of names of master notebooks **WITHOUT** any file extension|
| notebook_file_extension | A file extension of master notebooks. This key accepts only two values, namely `db` for databricks notebooks, and `jp` for Jupyter notebooks. |
| notebook_folder | A path to a directory that stores master notebooks. For databricks notebooks, they are stored in `master/db`, and for Jupyter notebooks, they are stored in `master/jp`. Different directory names or paths are also possible, if necessary. |
| target_notebook_folder | A directory where extracted notebooks (both lecture and assignment notebooks) are stored |
| target_notebook_book_folder | A directory where extracted notebooks in a form of e-book are stored (Support only Jupyter notebook)|
| assignments | A list of assignment numbers, which will be extracted into assignment notebooks from the master notebooks |
| CourseID | A course ID on Studium |
| CourseName | A course name on Studium |
| CourseInstance | This is usually a year in which the course is conducted.  |

### Make Lecture Notebook
Go into your course directory, and then into `GenerateMaterial` directory, and run the following command:-

    python3 generate.py

In this case, the extracted lecture notebooks are stored in `lectures` directory as specified in `config.json`.

### Make Assignment Notebook

Go into the course directory, and then into `GenerateMaterial` directory. One needs to open and edit  `generate_assignment.py` and specify in the function `makeAssignmentNotebook` what assignment number and cell types one needs the system to extract from master notebooks. See an example below:-

    course = IDSCourse()
    
    course.makeAssignmentNotebook(assignment_number = 3,notebook_type='problem')
    course.makeAssignmentNotebook(assignment_number = 3,notebook_type='problem_TEST')
    course.makeAssignmentNotebook(assignment_number = 3,notebook_type='problem_solution')
    course.makeAssignmentNotebook(assignment_number = 3,notebook_type='problem_solution_TEST')
    course.makeAssignmentNotebook(assignment_number = 3,notebook_type='solution')
    course.makeAssignmentNotebook(assignment_number = 3,notebook_type='solution_TEST')
    course.makeAssignmentNotebook(assignment_number = 3,notebook_type='TEST')

In the example above, it creates an object of `IDSCourse()` and calls `makeAssignmentNotebook()` function from the object. It call this function 7 times to generate 7 separate notebooks. For example, the first one generates a notebook with only problem cells (along with their corresponding Test cells). The second one generates a notebook with problem cells (along with their corresponding Test cells) and TEST cells. The third one generates a notebook with problem cells (along with their corresponding Test cells) and solution cells.  

> **Note !**
> Problem cells are always extracted together with their corresponding Test cells.
> This means the first line where 'problem' is specified shall generate a notebook with both problem and Test cells.

> For the argument `notebook_type`, if more than one cell types are needed to be extracted into another notebook, use `underscore` (`_`) to concatenate cell types.

Then, run the following command:-

    python3 generate_assignment.py

In this case, the extracted notebooks are also stored in `lectures` directory as specified in `config.json`.
